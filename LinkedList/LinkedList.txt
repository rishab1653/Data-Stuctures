A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

Each node of a list is made up of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.



// Linked list example in Java
// Linked list class
class ListNode
{
    // head of list
    Node head;
 
    // Node class
    class Node
    {
        int val;
        Node next;
          
        // Constructor to create a new node
        Node(int v) {
           val = v;
        }
    }
}
